    <!-- Summary of 3 Activities -->
    <div id="activity summary">
    <h3>SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES</h3>
      <p>
        The activities involves discussion within the team aboutT Applications, Control Interface and features of a Smart Building. Smart referss to receive real-time sensor data through IoT 
        applications with a user-friendly interface, using machine learning algorithms to provide suggestions or even take decisions and carry out the required task. Smart buildings include 
        the integration of IoT devices which results in increased efficiency and productivity.
